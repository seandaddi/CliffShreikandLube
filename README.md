This project is a 3d printable model for a circular grease applicator. The application is for biological macromolecular crystallography. The grease applicator applies grease in a cicrular pattern for 24-well trays in hanging drop protein crystallography. After printing, one simply adds grease to the larger piece, screws the smaller piece onto the top, and attaches a grease-filled syringe (5-10 mL) via the luer lock on top.
